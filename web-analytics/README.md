## Time spent:

1 hour

## Efficiency explanation

The solution is efficient because it uses data structures that allow for quick access and insertion of data, namely Maps and Sets.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the total number of visits across both days. This is because we perform a constant amount of work for each visit (adding the visit to the Map and Set, and later checking if the user visited any new pages).
